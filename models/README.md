# Models Directory

This directory stores:
- Trained neural network models (.h5 files)
- Scaler objects (.pkl files)
- Training history
- Visualization plots

## Files Generated After Training

- `fraud_detection_model.h5` - Trained Keras model
- `scaler.pkl` - StandardScaler for feature normalization
- `training_history.pkl` - Training metrics history
- `training_history.png` - Training visualization plots
- `visualizations/` - Evaluation plots (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)

**Note**: Model files are ignored by git due to large size.
